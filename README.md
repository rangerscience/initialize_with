# InitializeWith

![ci](https://github.com/rangerscience/initialize_with/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Utility gem to ease Ruby code development by replacing the common boiler plate:

```ruby
class MyClass
  def initialize param
    @param = param
  end
end
```

with

```ruby
class MyClass
  include InitializeWith
  initialize_with :param
end
```

## Installation

```gemfile
gem 'initialize_with'
```
```ruby
require "initialize_with"
```

## Usage
The aim is function "as you expect", and otherwise, see the rspec tests for more involved examples.

If you were writing:
```ruby
class MyClass
  def initialize foo, bar: 42
    @foo = foo
    @bar = bar
    call_some_function
  end
end
```

you can now write:
```ruby
class MyClass
  include InitializeWith
  initialize_with :foo, bar: 42 do
    call_some_function
  end
end
```

Additionally, it's safe to invoke multiple times:
```ruby
class MyClass
  include InitializeWith
  initialize_with :foo
  initialize_with bar: 42
end
```

### Inheritance
Simple inheritance works just fine:

```ruby
class Parent
  include InitializeWith
end

class MyClass
  initialize_with :foo, bar: 42
end
```

But note that there isn't a way to replicate something like `super` - you'll have to do things by hand (see the test suite for more).

## Development

`bundle install` to get started, `rspec` for tests, `bin/console` for an IRB that's already `reqiured` the library.
